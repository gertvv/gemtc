Released 2012-10-25

First official release of the GeMTC R package. The  package enables
Bayesian network meta-analysis (also known as MTC, Mixed Treatment Comparisons)
in R. Network meta-analysis models can be generated and then run using MCMC
software: JAGS (using the rjags package), OpenBUGS (using the BRugs package),
WinBUGS (using the R2WinBUGS package) or YADAS (provided by GeMTC). The GeMTC
GUI can be used instead of or in conjunction with the R package.
